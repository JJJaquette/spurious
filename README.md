spurious.js
===========

Spurious is a JavaScript library that (Express)[https://github.com/visionmedia/express] uses  to create mock web services quickly and easily.  Spurious can also generate **quality** fake data for your web services.

This library was born out of the frustration that comes with developing the front-end of an application and the back-end synchronously.  APIs that are not implemented, bugs, and other things can seriously hamper your front-end development.  As long as a resource definition is agreed upon, Spurious can generate a RESTful "mock" API that the front-end can consume.
